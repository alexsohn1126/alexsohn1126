### Hi, I am Alex

### Project Overviews

##### choc-spaced-corne

My only hardware project, but it holds a very special place in my heart.. I use the keyboard based on the PCBs provided in the repository everyday!
It includes instructions on how to build it, what kind of materials you'll need, and how much it costs.

##### yelp-analysis

This is a research project that I worked on, I dive deep on restaurant's ratings and how different cuisines are rated differently on Yelp.
You can check out this fun interactive map I have made on the dataset for this project: [Click me!](https://alexsohn1126.github.io/yelp-analysis/other/map/map.html)
